The acoustic feature extraction uses these voice-related libraries (in addition to standard python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, etc).

1) librosa
2) Parselmouth (https://github.com/YannickJadoul/Parselmouth) 
3) Prosodylab Aligner (https://github.com/prosodylab/Prosodylab-Aligner) 

The directories are:

- bin: scripts that run using voiceCode
- voiceCode: contains is the main feature extraction code, including code for auto-transcripts and parsing of transcripts
- doc: contains documentation files describing different features
